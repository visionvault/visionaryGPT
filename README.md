# VisionaryGPT: Harnessing Visionaries' Wisdom with Large Language Models

## Overview

Welcome to the "VisionaryGPT" project! Our mission is to utilize state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) to bring the brilliance of visionary individuals from the past back to life and leverage their insights to shape a better world.

## Project Objective

The primary objective of this project is to create an interactive platform that allows users to interact with virtual representations of historical visionaries. By training LLMs with extensive historical datasets, we aim to enable these models to emulate the thinking patterns and innovative ideas of the great minds of the past.

## Getting Started

To begin, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Set up the required environment and dependencies using the installation guide provided.
3. Train the LLMs using the curated historical datasets.
4. Interact with the revived visionaries and witness their wisdom firsthand.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from developers, historians, and AI enthusiasts who share our passion for merging history and AI to create a better future. Feel free to explore the codebase, suggest improvements, and contribute to expanding our dataset.

## Join the Journey
